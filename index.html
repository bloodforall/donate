<h2 style="font-family:verdana; color:white;">Facts About the Blood Donation Process:</h2>

    <p style="font-family:bold;color:white;">Blood donation is a simple, four-step process: registration, medical history and mini-physical, donation and refreshments.<br> It is a safe process, and a sterile needle is used only once for each donor and then discarded.<br>

    The actual blood donation typically takes less than 10-12 minutes. The entire process, from the time you arrive to the time you leave, takes about an hour and 15 minutes.<br>

    The average adult has about 10 pints of blood in his body. Roughly one pint is given during a donation.<br>
    A healthy donor may donate red blood cells every 56 days, or double red cells every 112 days. There are four types of transfusable products that can be derived from blood: red cells, platelets, plasma and cryoprecipitate. Typically, two or three of these are produced from a pint of donated whole blood — hence each donation can help save more than one life.<br><br></p>

<h3 style="font-family:verdana; color:white;">Quick Facts About Blood Donors:</h3>

    <p style="font-family:bold;color:white;">Half of Red Cross blood donors are male, and half are female.
    The Red Cross accepts blood donations only from volunteer donors. Among Red Cross donors in a given year, 19 percent donate occasionally, 31 percent are first-time donors and 50 percent are regular, loyal donors.<br>

    Only 7 percent of people in the United States. have type O-negative blood type, which is known as the universal blood type. Blood that is type O-negative can be given to people of all blood types. Type O-negative blood is needed in emergencies before the patient’s blood type is known and with newborns that need blood.<br></p>

<h4 style="font-family:verdana;color:white;">Why Donate Blood?</h4>

    <p style="font-family:bold;color:white;">You don’t need a special reason to give blood; you just need your own reason. Some of us give blood because we were asked by a friend. Some know that a family member or a friend might need blood some day. Some believe it is the right thing we do.
<br>
    The number one reason donors say they give blood is because they “want to help others.” (I donate because I was one of these people that needed help in the summer of 2004.)
<br>
    Whatever your reason, the need is constant and your contribution is important for a healthy and reliable blood supply. And you’ll feel good knowing you’ve helped change a life.
